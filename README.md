## Resolution To Complexity In Contract Management

#### Situation

Medium to large enterprises are losing approximately 9% of Revenue through Revenue leakage and 9% of spend through cost leakage because of poor interpretation and enforcement.

#### Complication

Until this point there isnâ€™t a better way to go through contracts and enforce terms and conditions. Hence, some large  organizations are maintaining teams to review them. For most of the generic clauses traditional contract management software would suffice but for customized clauses human intervention is required.

#### Resolution

With advancements in AI and LLM models, all contracts can be reviewed by LLMs and insights from them can be summarized and passed on to enforcement teams periodically to act.
